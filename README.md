## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

Iâ€™m Sneha â€” a molecular biology enthusiast with a growing passion for biomedical informatics and genomics. With a strong foundation in life sciences, Iâ€™m diving headfirst into the world of coding and data analysis, teaching myself one script at a time. While Iâ€™m still a beginner in programming, my strong foundation in molecular biology and genomics keeps me curious and motivated to decode lifeâ€™s mysteries through data. Half biologist, half data detective â€” 100% curious, always learning, and loving every step of the journey.
